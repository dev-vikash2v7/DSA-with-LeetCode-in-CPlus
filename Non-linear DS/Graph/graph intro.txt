# What is Graph Data Structure?

. A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. 
. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. 
. More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(E, V).


# Components of a Graph

Vertices: 
. Vertices are the fundamental units of the graph. 
. Sometimes, vertices are also known as vertex or nodes. Every node/vertex can be labeled or unlabelled.

Edges:
. Edges are drawn or used to connect two nodes of the graph
. It can be ordered pair of nodes in a directed graph
. Edges can connect any two nodes in any possible way
. There are no rules. Sometimes, edges are also known as arcs. Every edge can be labeled/unlabelled.


# Graphs are used to solve many real-life problems. 

. Graphs are used to represent networks
. The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network
. Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook
. For example, in Facebook, each person is represented with a vertex(or node)
. Each node is a structure and contains information like person id, name, gender, locale etc.


# A graph is a data structure that consists of the following two components: 

1. A finite set of vertices also called as nodes. 
2.  . A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge
    . The pair is ordered because (u, v) is not the same as (v, u) in case of a directed graph(di-graph)
    . The pair of the form (u, v) indicates that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v
    . The edges may contain weight/value/cost.



Real-Time Applications of Graph:
===========

Graphs are used to represent flow of control in computers.
Graphs are used in social networking sites where users act as nodes and connection between them acts as edges.
In an operating system, graphs are used as resource allocation graphs.
Graphs are used in Google maps to find the shortest route.
Graphs are also used in airlines system for effective route optimization. 
In-state transition diagrams, the graph is used to represent their states and their transition.
In transportation, graphs are used to find the shortest path.
In circuits, graphs can be used to represent circuit points as nodes and wires as edges.
Graphs are used in solving puzzles with only one solution, such as mazes.
Graphs are used in computer networks for Peer to peer (P2P) applications.
Graphs basically in the form of DAG(Directed acyclic graph) are used as alternative to blockchain for cryptocurrency. For example crypto like  IOTA, Nano are mainly based on DAG.
Advantages of Graph:

By using graphs we can easily find the shortest path, neighbors of the nodes, and many more.
Graphs are used to implement algorithms like DFS and BFS.
It is used to find minimum spanning tree which has many practical applications.
It helps in organizing data.
Because of its non-linear structure, helps in understanding complex problems and their visualization.
Disadvantages of Graph:

Graphs use lots of pointers which can be complex to handle.
It can have large memory complexity.
If the graph is represented with an adjacency matrix then it does not allow parallel edges and multiplication of the graph is also difficult. 









What is a Graph?
=========
A graph consists of a finite set of vertices or nodes and a set of edges connecting these vertices. Two vertices are said to be adjacent if they are connected to each other by the same edge.

Some basic definitions related to graphs are given below. You can refer to Figure 1 for examples.

Order: The number of vertices in the graph
Size: The number of edges in the graph
Vertex degree: The number of edges that are incident to a vertex
Isolated vertex: A vertex that is not connected to any other vertices in the graph
Self-loop: An edge from a vertex to itself
Directed graph: A graph where all the edges have a direction indicating what is the start vertex and what is the end vertex
Undirected graph: A graph with edges that have no direction
Weighted graph: Edges of the graph has weights
Unweighted graph: Edges of the graph has no weights
