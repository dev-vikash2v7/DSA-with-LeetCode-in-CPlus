# The following two are the most commonly used representations of a graph. 
1. Adjacency Matrix 
2. Adjacency List 

Adjacency Matrix: 

. Adjacency Matrix is a 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of vertices in a graph
. Let the 2D array be adj[][], a slot adj[i][j] = 1 indicates that there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j
. Adjacency matrix for undirected graph is always symmetric. Adjacency Matrix is also used to represent weighted graphs
. If adj[i][j] = w, then there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j with weight w. 


Pros: 
. Representation is easier to implement and follow
. Removing an edge takes O(1) time
. Queries like whether there is an edge from vertex ‘u’ to vertex ‘v’ are efficient and can be done O(1).

Cons:
. Consumes more space O(V^2). Even if the graph is sparse(contains less number of edges), it consumes the same space
. Adding a vertex is O(V^2) time.  Computing all neighbors of a vertex takes O(V) time (Not efficient).



# Adjacency List: 

. An array of linked lists is used
. The size of the array is equal to the number of vertices
. Let the array be an array[]
. An entry array[i] represents the linked list of vertices adjacent to the ith index
. This representation can also be used to represent a weighted graph. The weights of edges can be represented as lists of pairs
 

 0----1\                   0 : 1 -> 4
 |   /| \                  1 : 0 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2
 |  / |   2 ------------>  2 : 1 -> 3
 | /  | /                  3 : 1-> 2-> -> 4
 4----3/                   4 : 0 -> 1 -> 3

Pros:
. Saves space O(|V|+|E|)
. In the worst case, there can be C(V, 2) number of edges in a graph thus consuming O(V^2) space
. Adding a vertex is easier. Computing all neighbors of a vertex takes optimal time.

Cons: 
. Queries like whether there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v are not efficient and can be done O(V).
. In Real-life problems,  graphs are sparse(|E| <<|V|2)
. That’s why adjacency lists Data structure is commonly used for storing graphs
. Adjacency matrix will enforce (|V|2) bound on time complexity for such algorithms. 



Graph Representation:
========

Graph can be represented in the following ways:

Set Representation: 
      . Set representation of a graph involves two sets:
      . Set of vertices V = {V1, V2, V3, V4} and set of edges E = {{V1, V2}, {V2, V3}, {V3, V4}, {V4, V1}}
      . This representation is efficient for memory but does not allow parallel edges.

Sequential Representation:
      . This representation of a graph can be represented by means of matrices:
      . Adjacency Matrix, Incidence matrix and Path matrix.

        Adjacency Matrix: This matrix includes information about the adjacent nodes. Here, aij = 1 if there is an edge from Vi to Vj otherwise 0. It is a matrix of order V×V.
        Incidence Matrix: This matrix includes information about the incidence of edges on the nodes. Here, aij = 1 if the jth edge Ej is incident on ith vertex Vi otherwise 0. It is a matrix of order V×E.
        Path Matrix: This matrix includes information about the simple path between two vertices. Here, Pij = 1 if there is a path from Vi to Vj otherwise 0. It is also called as reachability matrix of graph G.  

Linked Representation:
      . This representation gives the information about the nodes to which a specific node is connected i.e. adjacency lists
      . This representation gives the adjacency lists of the vertices with the help of array and linked lists
      . In the adjacency lists, the vertices which are connected with the specific vertex are arranged in the form of lists which is connected to that vertex
