What is a Spanning Tree?
==============
A Spanning tree is a subset to a connected graph G, where all the edges are connected, 
i.e, one can traverse to any edge from a particular edge with or without intermediates
. Also, a spanning tree must not have any cycle in it. Thus we can say that if there are N vertices in a connected graph
 then the no. of edges that a spanning tree may have is N-1.
 or
 A spanning tree is a subset of Graph G, which has all the vertices covered with minimum possible number of
edges. Hence, a spanning tree does not have cycles and it cannot be disconnected.
By this definition, we can draw a conclusion that every connected and undirected Graph G has at least one
spanning tree. A disconnected graph does not have any spanning tree, as it cannot be spanned to all its
vertices. 
We found three spanning trees off one complete graph. A complete undirected graph can have maximum nn2
 number of spanning trees, where n is the number of nodes. In the above addressed example, n is
3, hence 3ϯ−Ϯ = 3spanning trees are possible.

What is a Minimum Spanning Tree? 
===============

Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects
 all the vertices together. A single graph can have many different spanning trees. 
 
 A minimum spanning tree (MST)
  or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected, undirected graph is a spanning tree with a weight less 
  than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given 
  to each edge of the spanning tree.

or 

In a weighted graph, a minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree that has minimum weight than all other
spanning trees of the same graph. In real-world situations, this weight can be measured as distance,
congestion, traffic load or any arbitrary value denoted to the edges.



 How many edges does a minimum spanning tree has? 
 -------------------
A minimum spanning tree has (V – 1) edges where V is the number of vertices in the given graph. 


What are the applications of the Minimum Spanning Tree? 
======================

1. Network design
-------------
telephone, electrical, hydraulic, TV cable, computer, road 
The standard application is to a problem like phone network design
. You have a business with several offices; you want to lease phone lines to connect them up with each other, and the phone
 company charges different amounts of money to connect different pairs of cities
 . You want a set of lines that connects all your offices with a minimum total cost
 . It should be a spanning tree, since if a network isn’t a tree you can always remove some edges and save money.

2. Approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems
-----------------

traveling salesperson problem, Steiner tree 
A less obvious application is that the minimum spanning tree can be used to approximately solve the traveling salesman problem
. A convenient formal way of defining this problem is to find the shortest path that visits each point at least once.

3. Indirect applications
-----------------

Max bottleneck paths 
LDPC codes for error correction 
Image registration with Renyi entropy 
Learning salient features for real-time face verification 
Reducing data storage in sequencing amino acids in a protein 
Model locality of particle interactions in turbulent fluid flows 
Autoconfig protocol for Ethernet bridging to avoid cycles in a network

4. Cluster analysis 
---------------
k clustering problem can be viewed as finding an MST and deleting the k-1 most expensive edges.
